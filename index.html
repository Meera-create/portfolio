            <h3>A little about me..</h3>
            <p>I currently work in healthcare so am more used to dealing with people, their health 
                and all that fun stuff. At some point, I felt like it was time for a change, a 
                complete change!
                So through friends, I cam across coding and decided to investigate  further, soon realised
                I enjoyed it and here i am.

        <div class="why_tech">
            <h3>What have i enjoyed learning so far? Good question!</h3>
            <p>NO offence to the terminal but it's not for me, I much prefer playing around
                with CSS to see how ugly I can make my page, using terrible colour schemes, the works!
